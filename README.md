# Snake clone, made with Dosato, my own programming language.

This is a simple snake clone made with Dosato, my own programming language. It's a simple game, but it's a good way to show how to make a game with Dosato.<br>

## How to install

To install the game, you need to have Dosato installed. You can download it [here](https://github.com/Robotnik08/cdosato).<br>
After you have installed Dosato, you need to download the dosato_graphics library. You can download it [here](https://github.com/Robotnik08/dosato_graphics).<br>

Make sure to have path variables set up to your dosato exe, and the dosato_graphics library.<br>

After you have installed both Dosato and dosato_graphics, run the game with the following command:<br>
```
dosato main.to
```

## How to play

The game is a simple snake clone, move with WASD, and start the game with the space key. <br>
Before the game starts, you can choose the size of the game board. <br>
